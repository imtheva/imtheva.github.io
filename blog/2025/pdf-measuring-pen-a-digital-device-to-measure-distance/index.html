Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Protein &amp; Peptide Letters, 2010In insects numerous physiological processes are regulated by neuropeptides. Two fluorescent analogues of the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine were synthesized and incorporated in the diuretic neuropeptide helicokinin I from the moth Heliothis zea. By fluorescence emission measurements it was shown that both fluorescent helicokinin I analogues react sensitive on the dielectricity of their microenvironment. A helicokinin I analogue containing the fluorescent tryptophan mimic -[6’-(N,N-dimethyl)-amino-2’-naphthoyl]alanine (Ald) was shown to bind to dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles by the Ald residue. A membrane binding model for helicokinin I is proposed based on data from related mammalian and insect-neuropeptides.2013Bibliografía recomendada para el Tema: 3.2.-Moléculas diatómicas.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the principle of non-Newtonian capillary rheometry for quality control purposes. In the investigation, three series of acrylic-based viscoelastic coating samples with different types and concentrations of pigments and thickening agents were used, and the rheological measurements were compared to results obtained with the so-called Stormer viscometer and an advanced off-line rheometer. A detailed analysis of the potential measurement implications was also conducted. For shear stresses from 15.0 to 350.0 Pa (the upper boundary), the novel capillary rheometer was found to provide results in good quantitative agreement with the advanced rheometer when sample holding time, and thereby shear history, was properly controlled. At a shear stress between 1.0 Pa (lower boundary) and 15.0 Pa, the agreement was less good, with a difference in results of the non-Newtonian capillary rheometer and the advanced rheometer between 15 and 74 %. The resolution of the capillary rheometer was sufficiently high to allow detection of the rheology changes associated with variations in coating formulations of pigment volume and rheology modifier concentrations. In summary, for fast on-line evaluation of coating rheology, the principle of capillarity has been demonstrated to be a varied and robust technique.Heavy -y- Metal. Vol. 1: A través del cristal. Nuevas perspectivas culturales, 2019Autenticidad. Concepto central para la cultura urbana, aunque al mismo tiempo uno de los más ambiguos y subjetivos de cuantos contribuyen a construir sus respectivos discursos musicales. Reclamada, exigida, defendida, pero también vilipendiada, la autenticidad es una de las grandes protagonistas del código subcultural del heavy metal, alrededor de la cual se establecen toda una serie de relaciones básicas entre creadores, seguidores, sociedad e industria que posibilitan el desarrollo de la escena. Ahora bien, ¿qué factores están implicados en su definición? ¿Cómo se articulan los procesos que ayudan a determinar qué y quién es más y/o menos auténtico? ¿Es la autenticidad un concepto estático, o dinámico? ¿Cómo ha influido en la evolución del heavy metal en tanto fenómeno sociocultural y comercial? ¿Qué problemática intrínseca tiene? Después de cuarenta años, e inmersos en pleno siglo XXI, se antoja necesaria una revisión profunda de sus parámetros, y abrir la puerta de esta manera a un debate que ayude a redefinir o reafirmar sus términos dentro de una sociedad y un mercado que han experimentado profundos y significativos cambios.Dental Press Journal of Orthodontics, 2017Objective: the objective of the study was to determine the relationship between dental calcification stages and skeletal maturation in a Peruvian sample. Methods: panoramic, cephalometric and carpal radiographs of 78 patients (34 girls and 44 boys) between 7 and 17 years old (9.90 ± 2.5 years) were evaluated. Stages of tooth calcification of the mandibular canine, first premolar, second premolar, and second molar and the skeletal maturation with a hand-wrist and a cervical vertebrae method were assessed. The relationships between the stages were assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Additionally, the associations of mandibular and pubertal growth peak stages with tooth calcification were evaluated by Fisher’s exact test. Results: all teeth showed positive and statistically significant correlations, the highest correlation was between the mandibular second molar calcification stages with hand-wrist maturation stages (r = 0.758, p &lt; 0.001) and with vertebrae cervical m…EFFECTS OF HYPERTENSION AND ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION ON MALE INFERTILITY- INTERGRATIVE REVIEW, 2023ABSTRACT Introduction It is estimated that 1.28 billion adults aged between 30 to 70 years worldwide have hypertension and two thirds of these live in the low and middle-income countries. Hypertension is a leading preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature deaths. Hypertension and anti-hypertensive have been associated with decreased semen volume, sperm count, motility, abnormal sperm morphology and erectile dysfunction. Consequently, hypertension and anti-hypertensives contribute to male infertility. Male infertility contributes over 50% of the cases of infertility amongst couples and studies have shown that male infertility increases with 0.3% annually. Methods This is an integrative literature review on published articles. Purposeful sampling was used. Relevant data from PubMed, Medline, Google scholar, Cochrane and ResearchGate was searched, evaluated for its relevance and reviewed. Further, grey literature was reviewed and the search was done in English. Owing to the scarcity of the research data in this field, the search went as far back as 20 years ago. Results The search strategy yielded a grand total of 99,434 electronic citations from the years 2003 to 2023, a period of 20 years. 112 study papers were included and scrutinized in the integrative literature review and thematic data analysis was done on effects of hypertension and the antihypertensive drugs on male fertility. Conclusion Men with hypertension have a higher risk of experiencing fertility problems than men without hypertension. Studies have also found that the use of certain antihypertensive medications negatively affects sperm quality, volume and motility and consequently, male fertility. Antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men should be based on the individual’s overall health and his reproductive health needs. Lifestyle modifications are beneficial for men with hypertension who are trying to conceive through medical interventions as compared to surgical interventions.Still studying.— This paper deals with the design and implementation of a simple HMC6352 2-axis digital compass. Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.2013S83 Correspondence to: Uthaisang-Tanechpongtamb W, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, 114 Sukhumvit 23, Wattana, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.

Linear and volumetric measurements were performed on 117 specimens (test diameter &gt; 40 mm) and the ratios between them were analyzed along with Aristotle’s lantern weight participation (AL index). The potential model was tested between AL wet weight and tooth height (log data), estimating the coefficients by linear regression. Echinoid specimens from Pituba (<italic>n</italic> = 57) manifested a higher average degree of sphericity and test thickness. Proportionally, this population also showed higher AL and tooth height, indicating that the dimensions of this structure exhibit particularities in the spatial arrangement along the oral-aboral axis of the echinoids. Negative allometric relationships (β &lt; 1) were observed in all specimens. The environments with distinct characteristics and wide food availability associated with a broad spectrum of the trophic niche occupied by the populations point out modulations and specializations of morphofunctional strategies and the expression of phenotypes.Academia Oncology, 2024Introduction: Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Between 10% and 30% of endometrial adenocarcinomas exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI), a genetic hypermutability that results from an impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MSI can be indirectly identified by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for deficient MMR protein expression and may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern of invasion can be identified on histologic review and has also been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. It is unknown whether this phenotype of invasion is associated with MSI, and to date, no studies have correlated MMR status and MELF-pattern invasion in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In this study, we examine the correlation between these factors. Methods: We performed an IRB-approved, retrospective review of medical records and pathology slides of surgical cases of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma between January 2016 and January 2020. Results: MMR mutations were present in 35%, MELF-pattern invasion was present in 29%, and both factors were present in 9.4% of specimens. We did not demonstrate a correlation between MMR mutation status and the presence of MELF-pattern invasion (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15). Conclusions: Our study did not demonstrate a relationship between MMR status and the presence of MELF-pattern invasion. MSI instability may not play a role in the pathogenesis of MELF-pattern invasion. Future study into the association between MELF-pattern invasion and other genetic mutations that arise within endometrial adenocarcinoma is warranted.International journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science reviews, 2024Background and Aims: Currently, in China nursing graduates of higher vocational colleges are restricted by many factors, particularly career development. Career development is an important indicator for measuring the quality of nursing graduates and the extent to which government and hospitals attach importance to the employment of nursing graduates in higher vocational colleges. Therefore, it is necessary to delve into the career development of nursing graduates in vocational colleges under the current employment situation. This study mainly aimed to investigate the current situation of nursing graduates’ career development and factors affecting the career development of nursing graduates. Materials and Methods: The sample was drawn from the 2019 nursing graduates in Weifang Nursing Vocational College using non-random sampling. These nursing graduates participated in the research voluntarily participation and accepted their participation in the research consent form. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The questions focused on many factors that affected their career development, including how hiring practices at government, hospitals, and colleges, factors affecting the recruitment process, and challenges facing career development. Results: The results show that nursing graduates have basic knowledge and skills in nursing. The results also showed that government employment policies, teaching program management, and employability development were the key factors influencing the career development of nursing graduates from higher vocational colleges are relatively successful. Additionally, results indicated that school-based classroom environments have a significant and positive impact on nursing graduates’ career development. The government should increase employment efficiency and change employment policies as necessary to achieve sustainable professional development. Educational institutions and nursing schools should improve their teaching and learning management systems to align with employment policies and needs. Conclusion: The results emphasize how crucial it is for the government to get involved in employment policy optimization to promote the nursing profession’s long-term growth. In addition, educational establishments need to modify their pedagogical approaches to better prepare nursing graduates for the skills required by changing job markets and facilitate a smooth entry into the workforce.</p> </body></html>
