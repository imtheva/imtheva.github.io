Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture, 2019Journal of Scientific Research, 2019Six new bis-azo disperse dyes were synthesized by linking various aryl amino and hydroxyl derivatives to 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline and 6-amino-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine moieties through diazo coupling reactions. The structures of the bis-azo dyes were identified by Fourier transform infrared, proton and carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance data. The prepared dyestuffs were applied onto polyester and nylon 6 fabrics and subsequently their fastness properties in terms of light, washing, sublimation and rubbing were determined. Compared with the light fastness of polyester fabrics, the light fastness of the dyed nylon 6 fabrics were slightly lower. The technical performance of the dyes on the two textile substrates used for the study, demonstrated their useful applications in the dyeing of synthetic fibres.Applied Sciences, 2021Ultrasmall nanoparticles are potential candidates for application as high-performance imaging agents. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of folic acid (FA)-conjugated polyacrylic acid (PAA)-coated MnO nanoparticles with an average particle diameter of 2.7 nm. FA conferred cancer-targeting ability, while PAA conferred good colloidal stability and low cellular cytotoxicity on the FA-PAA-coated MnO nanoparticles. Further, the nanoparticles exhibited a high relaxivity (r1) value of 9.3 s−1mM−1 (r2/r1 = 2.2). Their application potential as cancer-targeting T1 magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents was confirmed by their enhanced T1 contrast enhancements at the brain cancer (U87MG) site upon intravenous administration to mice tails.Urology, 2015To determine the extent, severity, and sex differences of psychosocial deficits in men and women with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS), which in the past have been considered separate bladder (interstitial cystitis-painful bladder syndrome) and prostate (chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome) disorders. Evaluations of men and women separately suggest UCPPS is associated with increased anxiety and depression. However, studies directly testing deficits in broader psychosocial domains such as cognitive processes, intimate relationships, and trauma history, or tests of sex differences in the pattern of difficulties associated with UCPPS have not been performed. A total of 233 female and 191 male UCPPS patients and 235 female and 182 male healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from 6 academic medical centers in the United States and evaluated with a comprehensive battery of symptom, psychosocial, and illness impact measures. Primary comparisons of interest were be…Dicle Üniversitesi Veteriner Fakültesi DergisiBu çalışma Konya ilinde 2-6 aylık 121 adet yavru sokak köpeğinin gastro-intestinal helmint ve protozoon enfeksiyonlarının yaygınlığını belirlemek amacıyla yapılmıştır. Bu amaçla toplanan gaita örnekleri Fulleborn flotasyon ve sedimantasyon yöntemleri ile incelenmiştir. Mikroskobik muayenede tespit edilen helmint yumurtası ile protozoon kist, ookist ve sporokistleri ilgilili teratürler yardımıyla teşhis edilmiştir. Toplamda 121 adet gaita numunesinin 92’si (%76.03) helmint ve protozoon enfeksiyonları açısından pozitif bulunmuştur. Gaita örneklerinde protozon parazitlerden Giardia spp. kistleri (%2.48), Sarcocystis spp. sporokistleri (%2.48) ve Isospora spp. ookistlerine (%26.45) rastlanmıştır. Gastrointestinal helmintlerden ise cestod ve nematode enfeksiyonlarına rastlanmış, ancak herhangi bir trematod enfeksiyonu belirlenmemiştir. Çalışmada helmintlerden Joyeuxiella spp. (%1.65), Dipylidium caninum (%10.74), Taenia/Echinococcus spp. (%0.83), Toxascaris leonina (%33.06), Toxacara can…AMHA RECORDS oeuvres complètes *Aucun lien de parenté entre Tessemma et Amha (pas plus qu’avec Alèmayèhu Eshèté).

Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.Chemical Physics, 1999Ilmu Kelautan : Indonesian Journal of Marine Sciences, 2017Jurnal Udayana Mengabdi, 2019Jurnal Udayana Mengabdi, 2019</p> </body></html>
