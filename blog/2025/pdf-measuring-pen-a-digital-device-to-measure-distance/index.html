Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Intelligent Human Systems Integration (IHSI 2022) Integrating People and Intelligent Systems, February 22–24, 2022, Venice, ItalyContextConditionally autonomous vehicles are studied for numerous reasons, due to the dual responsibility in the driving task, switching from the car to the driver depending on the situation. This transition of control, namely the takeover, is usually not a concern when initiated by the driver. However, when the car issues a takeover request (TOR), it does it without consideration for the driver state, or anything else. In such a situation, the driver can be out of the driving loop, unaware of the current environment or focusing on a non-driving-related task (NDRT), impacting the takeover quality.&gt;ObjectiveIn this study, the goal is to find out if a Machine Learning can take advantages of many different factors and how they interact together, to create a model able to predict the takeover quality. Factors highlighted by the literature were considered: the driver physiological state, the external environment, the driver current activity and the modality of the TOR. Some studies tr…Informație geografică , 2025Frontiers in Earth Science, 2014The participation of the general public in the research design, data collection and interpretation process together with scientists is often referred to as citizen science. While citizen science itself has existed since the start of scientific practice, developments in sensing technology, data processing and visualization, and communication of ideas and results, are creating a wide range of new opportunities for public participation in scientific research. This paper reviews the state of citizen science in a hydrological context and explores the potential of citizen science to complement more traditional ways of scientific data collection and knowledge generation for hydrological sciences and water resources management. Although hydrological data collection often involves advanced technology, the advent of robust, cheap, and low-maintenance sensing equipment provides unprecedented opportunities for data collection in a citizen science context. These data have a significant potential to create new hydrological knowledge, especially in relation to the characterization of process heterogeneity, remote regions, and human impacts on the water cycle. However, the nature and quality of data collected in citizen science experiments is potentially very different from those of traditional monitoring networks. This poses challenges in terms of their processing, interpretation, and use, especially with regard to assimilation of traditional knowledge, the quantification of uncertainties, and their role in decision support. It also requires care in designing citizen science projects such that the generated data complement optimally other available knowledge. Lastly, using 4 case studies from remote mountain regions we reflect on the challenges and opportunities in the integration of hydrologically-oriented citizen science in water resources management, the role of scientific knowledge in the decision-making process, and the potential contestation to established community institutions posed by co-generation of new knowledge.Australia and New Zealand Health Policy, 2008This article provides a conceptual framework for thinking about the role of law in responding to population weight gain in Australia. Part 1 focuses on two core questions. Firstly, in pursuing the aim of weight reduction at the population level, what should law be trying to influence? The challenge here is to identify a model of the determinants of obesity that is adequate for legal purposes and that illustrates the entry points where law could best be used as an instrument of public health policy. Secondly, what kinds of strategies and tools can law offer to obesity prevention? The challenge here is to identify a model of law that captures the variety of contributions law is capable of making, at different levels of government, and across different legal systems. In Part 1 of the article, I argue that although law can intervene at a number of levels, the most important opportunities lie in seeking to influence the social, economic and environmental influences that shape patterns of eating and nutrition across the population as a whole. Only policies that impact broadly across the population can be expected to influence the weight distribution curve that has shifted relentlessly to the right in recent decades. Part 2 of the article builds on this analysis by offering a critical review of selected legal strategies for healthier nutrition and obesity prevention.Figshare , 2025The Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) represents a significant shift in Kenya’s education system, emphasizing learner-centered approaches and practical skill development. However, the success of its implementation greatly depends on the preparedness of school leaders. This article examines the current state of readiness among school heads, the challenges they face, and the support structures required for effective CBC rollout. It concludes that while awareness of CBC is widespread, many school leaders still lack adequate training, resources, and institutional support to lead this educational reform confidently.— This paper deals with the design and implementation of a simple HMC6352 2-axis digital compass. Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.2015Background: An indwelling urinary catheter or urethral stent are standardly used following a urethroplasty to prevent post-operative urinary retention. There are both closed drainage system (CDS) and open drainage system (ODS) available. Objective: The study was designed to determine the outcomes between post-operative CDS and ODS. Material and Method: Fifty-seven hypospadias patients with 66 urethroplasties, performed by a single surgeon, were assessed. During the 40-month study period, the operative outcomes relative to the technique of both urinary catheter drainage systems were evaluated for length of hospital stay (LOS), cost of hospitalization, and post-operative complications. Results: CDS and ODS drainage systems were performed in 32 and 34 operations, respectively. The patient characteristics, the surgical profiles, and post-operative complications were not statistically significant. The CDS/ODS group had median LOS (range) of 9 (1 to 22)/2 (1 to 6) days, respectively, and …Abacus, 2020Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis dan menguji kebenaran hipotesis mengenai hubungan langsung kecerdasan numerik dan kemandirian belajar terhadap kemampuan pemecahan masalah matematik.

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of patients with diabetes mellitus to their treatment. For this purpose, a systematic review was carried out, where relevant studies were searched in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases with specific keywords, and, subsequently, the most appropriate studies were selected (based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria) and analyzed. In total, from the literature search, 16 studies were identified. Based on these studies, patients with diabetes mellitus show quite low adherence to insulin therapy. The perceptions about the disease of diabetes, the availability of drugs, the diabetes education provided, perceptions of medication, current patients’ employment, younger age, educational level, nationality, HbA1c levels, abstinence from alcohol, presence of peripheral vascular disease, income, keeping their appointments in primary health care, and the religious beliefs about healing and healing practices are important factors influencing the compliance of patients with diabetes in their treatment. Adherence of patients with diabetes mellitus to treatment is an extremely important issue for them since the lack of it negatively affects not only the health of patients but also their quality of life.Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics, 2017</p> </body></html>
