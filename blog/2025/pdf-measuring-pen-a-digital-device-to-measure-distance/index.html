Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING &amp; PROCESSING MANAGEMENT, 2017U ovom radu autori su razvili i implementirali HACCP plan za proces proizvodnjefermentisanih proizvoda od mlijeka, što je prikazano na primjeru jogurta.

This study examines the time and dosage needed to achieve target blood pressure levels using two antihypertensive agents: oral Nifedipine retard and intravenous Labetalol. Through a randomized trial, it aims to provide insights into the safety and efficacy of these treatments, enhancing management strategies for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Materials and Methods: A randomized study with 104 pregnant women who had a blood pressure of 160/110 mm Hg or higher compared the effects of Nifedipine (20 mg every 30 minutes, up to five doses) and Labetalol (20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg every 15 minutes) until a target blood pressure of 150/100 mm Hg or lower was reached. The main focus was on the time and dosage needed to achieve this goal. Results: The mean time to achieve target blood pressure was significantly shorter with IV Labetalol (33.85 ± 11.87 minutes) compared to oral Nifedipine (48.56 ± 17.36 minutes; P &lt; 0.0001). The average dose required was lower for Nifedipine (1.73 ± 0.63 mg) than for Labetalol (2.06 ± 0.67 mg; P &lt; 0.01). The total dose needed was higher for Labetalol (70.00 ± 42.57 mg) compared to Nifedipine (33.71 ± 13.14 mg). Conclusion: Labetalol quickly lowers blood pressure, while oral nifedipine retard is also effective and well tolerated for managing severe hypertension, showing minimal side effects.Tropical Medicine and Infectious Disease, 2022Background: Ghana joined the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF), established in the year 2000, with the aim of eliminating the disease as a public health problem through annual mass treatment of entire endemic populations. Since 2001, the country has implemented mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic districts, with great reductions in the population at risk for infection. However, in many districts, the elimination programme is faced with the presence of hotspots, which may be due in part to individuals not taking part in MDA (either intentionally or unintentionally) who may serve as reservoirs to sustain transmission. This paper compares the LF-related perceptions among individuals who regularly take the MDA drugs and those who seldom or never take part in the MDA in the Ahanta West Municipality of Ghana to determine community acceptable ways to implement an intervention aimed to track, engage, and treat individuals who regularly miss MDA or to test individuals who intentionally refuse MDA and treat them if positive for LF. Methods: This was a mixed method study employing questionnaire surveys and focus group discussions (FDG) for data collection. Survey participants were randomly selected from the 2019 treatment register to stratify respondents into treated and non-treated groups. FGD participants were selected purposively such that there are at least two non-treated persons in each discussion session. Results: Over 90% of the respondents were aware of the disease. Poor hygiene/dirty environment was wrongly reported by most respondents (76.8%) as the causes. MDA awareness was very high among both treated (96.9%) and non-treated (98.6%) groups. A low sense of vulnerability to LF infection was evident by a reduction in the number of people presenting clinical manifestations of the disease in communities. Slightly more, 65 (29.0%) of the non-treated group compared to the 42 (19.4%) treated group reported ever experiencing adverse effects of the MDA drugs. Barriers to MDA uptake reported in both groups were poor planning and implementation of the MDA, lack of commitments on the part of drug distributors, and adverse drug reactions. About 51% of the non-treated group reported never taking the drugs even once in the last five years, while 61% among the treated group took the MDA drug consistently in the past five years. Respondents in both groups believed that, when engaged properly, most non-treated persons will accept to take the drug but insisted community drug distributors (CDDs) must be trained to effectively engage people and have time for those they will be engaging in dialogue. The chiefs emerged as the most influential people who can influence people to take MDA drugs. Conclusions: The reduction in risk perception among respondents, adverse reactions and the timing of MDA activities may be influencing MDA non-participation in the study area; however, respondents think that non-treated individuals will accept the interventions when engaged properly by the CDDs.Journal of Cancer, 2019Purpose: Prostate cancer (PCa) varies clinically from very indolent, not requiring therapeutic intervention, to highly aggressive, entailing radical treatment. Currently, stratification of PCa aggressiveness is mostly based on Gleason score, serum PSA and TNM stage, but outcome prediction in an individual basis is suboptimal. Thus, perfecting pre-therapeutic discrimination between indolent and aggressive PCa, avoiding overtreatment is a major challenge. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows epithelial cells to acquire mesenchymal properties, constituting a critical step in tumor invasion and metastization. Thus, we hypothesized that EMT-related markers might allow for improved assessment of PCa aggressiveness. Methods and Results: Using RealTime ready Custom Panel 384 assay, 93 EMT-related genes were assessed in normal prostate tissues (NPT, n=5), stage pT2a+b-PCa (n=5) and stage pT3b-PCa (n=5), from which CAMK2N1, CD44, KRT14, TGFβ3 and WNT5A genes emerged as the most significantly altered. Expression levels were then evaluated in a larger series (16 NPT and 94 PCa) of frozen tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. Globally, CAMK2N1, CD44 and WNT5A displayed higher expression levels at higher stages and less differentiated PCa. CAMK2N1 and WNT5A immunoexpression analysis disclosed significantly lower expression in NPT and increasing proportion of high-expression cases from pT2a+b to pT3b and metastatic PCa. Furthermore, higher CAMK2N1 and WNT5A transcript levels associated with shorter disease-free and disease-specific survival. In multivariable analysis, a trend for WNT5A expression levels to independently predict DFS was disclosed (p=0.056). Conclusions: Globally, our findings suggest an association between PCa aggressiveness and increased expression of CAMK2N1 and WNT5A, reflecting the acquisition of effective EMT characteristics by PCa cells.— This paper deals with the design and implementation of a simple HMC6352 2-axis digital compass. Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.Jurnal Kimia Sains dan Aplikasi, 2019Jernang resin is secretion of jernang rattan (Daemonorops draco, Arecaceae family) fruits which is endemic in Southeast Asia. This resin has various biological activities and empirically used as wound healing, headache medicines, and fever remedies by Anak Dalam ethnic group from Jambi. This study was performed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of nonpolar fraction of D. draco resin which collected from Jambi Province, Sumatera, Indonesia. Resin was extracted with n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol respectively. The antioxidant properties of the extracts were then evaluated using i,i-diphenyl-2picryl-hidrazyl radical scavenging assay. The most active extract was further fractionated using n-hexane and methanol and separated using column chromatography and preparative thin layer chromatography. Separation of the extract was conducted through antioxidant assay-guided fractionation. Characterization of the active fraction was carried out by infrared spectroscopy. The result shows that ethyl acetate extract provides higher antioxidant activity (IC50 = 27.61 pg/mL) compare to methanol and n-hexane extracts. N-hexane fraction of ethyl acetate extract used for further separation using column and preparative thin layer chromatography due to its antioxidant activity. Separation using column chromatography resulting in 9 fractions (F.1-9). Fraction F.5 provide high antioxidant activity (IC50 = 17.27 pg/mL) and further separated using preparative thin layer chromatography resulting two fractions with lower antioxidant activity F.5.1 (IC50 = 85.18 pg/mL) and F.5. 2 (IC50 = 34-94 pg/mL). Characterization of fraction F.5.2 using infrared spectroscopy showed that component in fraction F.5.2 contains NH-substituted benzene.Jurnal Udayana Mengabdi, 2019The amount of teenage smokers has significantly increased in the present. The desire to smoke in teenagers is associated with the exposure of peer group. This is triggered by the urge to be accepted in the community and the lack of information. The beginning age of a person to smoke is getting younger. This phenomenon triggers the addiction and increase the vulnerability of serious diseases in the future. Therefore, there should be an effort to empower the teenagers by molding peer educator as RADAR. It has roles to influence their peer friends to avoid tobacco and campaign about the danger of tobacco and recent issues about tobacco in their school. The aims were decreasing the early teenage smokers and creating a sustainable extracurricular that generates regeneration of peer educator in SMPN 10 Denpasar. The methods were 1) Roadshow; 2) Trainings; 3) Selection and final; and 4) Campaign activity. The result showed that there was an increasing score from pretest to posttest after implementing the program which was 25.8%. The activities of RADAR in social media were shown from the amount of likes on each topic which comprised of 200 likes of the danger of tobacco, 90 likes of TAPS, 120 likes of PHW, and 100 likes of KTR. This program succeeded in educating the danger of tobacco in early teenagers and create an extracurricular in school. This program is expected to be applied in another junior high school in Bali.2022this study proposed a model to assess visitor experience quality and its effect on their image, perceived value, delight, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions in Iranian water parks. Based on convenience sampling, a sample of 384 visitors at five water parks in Mashhad, Iran was selected. Data were subjected to partial least squares analysis based on structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings of this study showed that quality of visitors’ experiences significantly affects water park image, perceived value, and visitor’s satisfaction. Also, water park image significantly affects perceived value, delight, and visitor’s satisfaction. Moreover, perceived value and water park image exert a direct influence on customer satisfaction, and they also positively affect behavioral intentions. But, the visitor’s delight affects indirectly and through satisfaction on behavioral intentions. Therefore, the results of this study will assist water parks management to develop and implement market-orientated service strategies both to increase experience quality and water park image and to enhance perceived value, delight, and satisfaction among visitors. It is hoped such changes will increase visitors’ favorable Davood Ghorbanzade ABOUT THE AUTHORS Davood Ghorbanzadeh is a Ph.D. Candidates Of Business Management-Marketing Management and graduated of MSc in Business Management-Marketing from the department of Management and Social science,Jurnal IPTA (Industri Perjalanan Wisata), 2023</p> </body></html>
