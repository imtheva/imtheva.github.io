Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Poznan University of Technology Academic Journals.

These genetic alterations drive uncontrolled proliferation and modulate responses to targeted treatments, significantly influencing clinical outcomes. This review examines the prevalence and prognostic implications of <italic>KRAS</italic> and <italic>NRAS</italic> mutations, with particular attention paid to the Venezuelan population. Reported frequencies in Venezuela (13–23% for <italic>KRAS</italic> and 1.6–2.6% for <italic>NRAS</italic>) are markedly lower than global averages (36–45% for <italic>KRAS</italic>), a discrepancy potentially attributable to population-specific genetic variations or methodological constraints of conventional sequencing techniques, which may lack sensitivity for variant detection. The presence of <italic>RAS</italic> mutations is a well-established biomarker of resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, necessitating alternative treatment regimens for affected patients. Although novel agents such as <italic>KRAS</italic> G12C inhibitors exhibit therapeutic potential, their efficacy remains under investigation in clinical trials, highlighting the need for regionally tailored drug development and improved access to innovative therapies in Venezuela. Beyond proliferative signaling, <italic>KRAS</italic>-mediated oncogenesis involves metabolic adaptation, angiogenic activation, and immune system evasion, underscoring its multifaceted role in CRC progression. Advanced molecular diagnostic techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, have significantly improved the detection of oncogenic mutations, offering higher sensitivity and specificity compared to traditional methods. However, their widespread adoption in resource-limited settings remains hindered by infrastructural, economic, and technical barriers.Academia Biology, 2025Correction InformationIn the original publication, there were errors in a data point described within the Abstract and Conclusions.

Drawing on comprehensive data from InfoCamere up to the end of 2024, combined with insights from surveys conducted in 2019, 2021, and 2023, the report identifies clear trends and strategic implications. This edition highlights the continued growth of network contracts, which reached a total of 9,630 by the end of 2024, involving approximately 50,000 enterprises nationwide. Notably, there has been a significant resurgence of micro-networks and intra-provincial collaborations, alongside increased sector-specific clustering. The agrifood sector leads in participation, followed by mechanical engineering and construction. The findings underscore the growing prominence of female entrepreneurship within these networks. Conversely, youth and foreign entrepreneurship remain limited, suggesting untapped potential and opportunities for policy interventions to enhance inclusivity. Geographical analyses reveal distinct regional patterns, with Veneto, Lombardy, and Emilia-Romagna standing out. The Observatory also explores network resilience through case studies such as Slow Bike Tourism and Jubea, which illustrate the flexible, responsive nature of these structures in navigating economic uncertainties. Additionally, the analysis examines financial strategies, particularly mini-bond issuance, highlighting missed opportunities to leverage network affiliation as a driver for attracting investment. Overall, the study emphasizes the strategic importance of adaptive governance models, promoting internal coordination, fostering trust among members, and enhancing organizational performance. This comprehensive evaluation offers valuable insights for businesses and policymakers seeking to optimize network effectiveness and economic resilience. Furthermore, the study highlights the pivotal role of associations, cooperatives, and foundations in facilitating network formation, strategic coordination, and the promotion of innovation and competitiveness.Programa de Fiestas de Cercedilla, 2025En octubre de 1925 el Ayuntamiento de Cercedilla inaugura su Fábrica de la Luz, un proyecto municipal pionero hoy convertido en un interesante museo2010Aún recuerdo aquellos días en los que miraba los tablones de la Facultad de Químicas buscando una oportunidad para investigar. El destino quiso que terminase estudiando la grasa láctea y, pese a los momentos duros, no puedo estar más que agradecida por las coordenadas en las que ha transcurrido este trabajo. En primer lugar, quiero agradecer a mis directores de tesis, la Dra. Manuela Juárez y el Dr. Miguel Ángel de la Fuente, el darme la oportunidad de dedicarme a lo que siempre quise hacer y su inestimable ayuda. No creo que haya muchos “jefes” que se impliquen tanto… La curiosidad por los resultados de cada experimento, la pasión que demuestran en su trabajo, serán siempre mis modelos científicos. Muchas gracias, Manoli, por trabajar intensamente en esta tesis a pesar de todos tus compromisos, por leerte mi Introducción en el AVE en vez de dar una cabezada, y especialmente, por tu apoyo personal en momentos clave. ¡Y qué decirle a Miguel Ángel! Gracias por meter prisa, por tus correcciones cervantinas, por los planning difíciles de cumplir, por tu compromiso, por las cañas en Delias… Con el tiempo, creo que hemos formado un buen tándem. Espero que no se te hayan quitado las ganas de dirigir otra tesis y que otros becarios aprendan como yo a tu lado.Still studying.— This paper deals with the design and implementation of a simple HMC6352 2-axis digital compass. Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.Journal of Tourism, Hotels and Heritage2007Clinical Immunology (Fourth Edition), 2013Journal of Entomology and Zoology studies, 2025This study provides a comprehensive overview of aspergillosis, also known as brooder pneumonia, a fatal fungal disease significantly impacting poultry health and the industry. The primary objectives are to elucidate the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies for aspergillosis in poultry. The disease is caused mainly by Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavus, ubiquitous environmental fungi that produce spores capable of infecting young and immunocompromised birds through inhalation or penetration of eggshells. The study emphasizes that environmental factors such as poor ventilation, high humidity, organic matter accumulation, and mismanagement practices are critical predisposing factors facilitating fungal growth and spore dissemination, especially in hatcheries and poultry houses. The material and methods involve reviewing existing literature, analyzing clinical and postmortem findings, and evaluating diagnostic techniques such as histopathology, culture, and molecular assays. Results indicate that aspergillosis manifests predominantly as acute or chronic respiratory disease, with clinical signs including nasal discharge, dyspnea, gasping, ocular lesions, and neurological symptoms like torticollis and paralysis. Gross pathology reveals granulomatous lesions in lungs, air sacs, and other organs, often with characteristic plaques. Diagnosis relies on clinical history, lesion examination, fungal isolation, and microscopic identification. Treatment options are limited and often ineffective; antifungal agents like itraconazole and amphotericin B are used, complemented by environmental management and supportive care. Prevention remains the most effective approach, focusing on stringent sanitation, adequate ventilation, biosecurity, and control of environmental contamination to reduce spore load. The findings underscore that controlling environmental factors and early intervention are vital to mitigate outbreaks. In conclusion, integrated management encompassing hygiene, environmental control, and judicious use of antifungal agents is essential to combat aspergillosis, safeguarding poultry health, and reducing economic losses.</p> </body></html>
