Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.บทความวิจัย รายงานการวิจัยในชั้นเรียน การพัฒนาความสามารถในการแก้ปัญหาฟิสิกส์และการเรียนรู้ค าศัพท์ วิทยาศาสตร์ภาษาอังกฤษ เรื่อง ไฟฟ้าฟ้าสถิต ของนักเรียนชั้นมัธยมศึกษาปีที่ 5 โรงเรียนสตูลวิทยา ที่ได้รับการจัดการเรียนรู้ แบบสืบเสาะหาความรู้ 7E ร่วมกับกระบวนการคิดเชิงเมตาคอกนิชัน2011Background: Patients with non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) present with diverse clinical, electrocardiographic, cardiac biomarker, echocardiographic and angiographic characteristics.

Within the complex realm of epigenetic modifications, hydroxymethylation emerges as a crucial factor in orchestrating mechanisms for neuroprotection and repair following such injuries. This review consolidates current research on the multifaceted role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in regulating molecular and cellular processes vital for neuronal survival and regeneration after cerebrovascular injury. The discussion delves into the dynamic interaction between hydroxymethylation and important pathways in neuroprotection, such as the modulation of excitotoxicity and cellular metabolism, resolution of inflammation, and mitigation of oxidative stress. Additionally, it explores emerging evidence suggesting that 5hmC contributes to neurorepair by promoting neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, angiogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Understanding the role of hydroxymethylation in cerebrovascular injury provides insights into potential therapeutic approaches for enhancing the brain’s innate mechanisms for protection and repair. By elucidating the intricate involvement of 5hmC in these injuries, this review establishes a basis for further research aimed at leveraging its therapeutic potential to alleviate neurological deficits and promote recovery in affected individuals.2014Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014is an open access repository that collects the work of Arts et Métiers ParisTech researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.

Revista de Sociologia, 2015Physics According to a 17-Year-Old Trying to Understand Scientific Papers (PL), 2024Fizyka według 17 latka próbującego zrozumieć prace naukoweInvestigative Opthalmology &amp; Visual Science, 2010To test the reproducibility of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) total retinal thickness (TRT) measurements in mice. METHODS. C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized, and three repeated volumetric images were acquired in both eyes with SD-OCT (250 A-scans ϫ 250 frames ϫ 1024 samplings), centered on the optic nerve head (ONH). The mice were repositioned between scans. TRT was automatically measured within a sampling band of retinal thickness with radii of 55 to 70 pixels, centered on the ONH by using custom segmentation software. The first volumetric image acquired in a given eye was used to register the remaining two SD-OCT images by manually aligning the en face images with respect to rotation and linear translation. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to global and quadrant thicknesses, taking into account the clustering between eyes, to assess imprecision (measurement reproducibility). RESULTS. Twenty-six eyes of 13 adult mice (age 13 weeks) were imaged. The mean global TRT across all eyes was 298.21 m, with a mouse heterogeneity standard deviation (SD) of 4.88 m (coefficient of variation [CV] ϭ 0.016), an eye SD of 3.32 m (CV ϭ 0.011), and a device-related imprecision SD of 2.33 m (CV ϭ 0.008). The superior quadrant had the thickest mean TRT measurement (310.38 m) and the highest (worst) imprecision SD (3.13 m; CV ϭ 0.010), and the inferior quadrant had the thinnest mean TRT (291.55 m). The quadrant with the lowest (best) imprecision SD was in the nasal one (2.06 m; CV ϭ 0.007). CONCLUSIONS. Good reproducibility was observed for SD-OCT retinal thickness measurements in mice. SD-OCT may be useful for in vivo longitudinal studies in mice. (New Covenant Publications International Ltd. , 2020Figshare , 2025The Competency-Based Curriculum (CBC) represents a significant shift in Kenya’s education system, emphasizing learner-centered approaches and practical skill development. However, the success of its implementation greatly depends on the preparedness of school leaders. This article examines the current state of readiness among school heads, the challenges they face, and the support structures required for effective CBC rollout. It concludes that while awareness of CBC is widespread, many school leaders still lack adequate training, resources, and institutional support to lead this educational reform confidently.</p> </body></html>
