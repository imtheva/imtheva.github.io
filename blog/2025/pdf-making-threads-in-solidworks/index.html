Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.Jurnal Psikologi Udayana, 2016Revista Turismo em Análise, 1992RESUMO: O Turismo, frente à questão ambiental. apresenta amplas possibilidades que vem sendo divulgadas pelos meios de comunicação.

Indeed, the liver was referred to by Galen 2 as the “blood sac” because of its abundant blood flow, which comes from its almost unique dual blood supply, namely, the hepatic artery and the portal vein (almost because there is also a portal venous system between the pituitary and the hypothalamus 3 ) (Fig. ). In 200 ce, Galen wrote of the liver as the fons venarum, the source of the major veins of the body and the sanguifactionis officina or the “factory of the blood,” the site of sanguification. 2 In modern times, even after the gross anatomy of the liver was clearly elucidated, poor understanding of liver disease resulted in a diagnosis of cirrhosis Abbreviations: ADAMTS13, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13; AHG, antihemophilic globulin; aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time; AT, antithrombin; C, protein C; FFP, fresh frozen plasma; HMWK,Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014is an open access repository that collects the work of Arts et Métiers ParisTech researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.

Previous studies also show that women who sustain intimate terrorism (IT), a form of IPV that is characterized by much violence and controlling behavior, are at even greater risk for PTSD than women who sustain common couple violence (CCV), a lower level of more minor, reciprocal IPV. However, no research has documented this trend in men who sustain IT versus CCV. The present study investigates the associations among sustaining IPV and PTSD among both a clinical and community sample of men. The clinical sample is comprised of 302 men who sustained IT from their female partners and sought help. The community sample is comprised of 520 men, 16% of whom sustained CCV. Analyses showed that in both samples, the associations between sustaining several types of IPV and PTSD were significant, and that men who sustained IT were at exponentially increased risk of exceeding the clinical cut-off on the PTSD measure than men who sustained CCV or no violence. The path models predicting PTSD symptoms differed for both samples, indicating that perhaps treatment implications differ by group as well.2017Cryogenics is dealing with very low temperatures of less than 120 K. Thermal insulation is a key to minimize heat leak in cryogenics during transportation in transfer line. The present study is conducted to derive three-dimensional heat transfer mathematical equations to predict conductivity of insulation systems for liquid nitrogen pipe flow. Elliptic differential equations on special domains were derived based on Fourier method for three-dimensional heat equations. As a result from the study, three-dimensional heat conduction equation for a cylindrical problem was successfully derived. The derived equation provides a mathematical solution to determine the heat transfer rate for a system of cryogenic pipe insulated with multiple layers.Einstein, 2024Sabadin et al. demonstrated that most yeasts isolated from patients who have undergone liver transplantation are susceptible to the antifungal agents fluconazole, amphotericin B, and micafungin. Fifteen patients presented with either atrophic or pseudomembranous oral candidiasis. Candida albicans and Candida glabrata were the most prevalent in these patients.Inflammation Research, 2003Objective: To investigate the effects of ibandronate, a novel aminobisphosphonate, on inflammation as well as leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in mouse antigen-induced arthritis (AiA). Material and Treatment: 36 Balb/c mice were subcutaneously injected with 160 mg/kg of ibandronate once per day beginning at day 7 until day 13 after induction of AiA. Methods: The severity of arthritis was assessed by changes of the transverse knee joint diameter. For the intravital fluorescence microscopy measurements on day 14 after AiA induction, the patella tendon was partly resected to visualize the intraarticular synovial tissue of the knee joint. The number of rolling and adherent leukocytes as well as red blood cell (RBC) velocity and functional capillary density (FCD) were quantified in synovial microvessels. Furthermore, leukocyte infiltration in the synovium was determined in histological sections with an established score. Results: Both fractions of rolling leukocytes (p = 0.016) as well as number of extravasated leukocytes (p = 0.004) were enhanced in control animals treated with ibandronate in comparison to animals which received saline. Arthritic animals with and without ibandronate treatment revealed an increased FCD (p = 0.006, p = 0.008), enhanced number of rolling ( p = 0.002, p = 0.001) and adherent leukocytes (p = 0.009, p = 0.007) and greater swelling of the left knee joint (p = 0.002, p = 0.001) when compared to control animals. No significant differences between arthritic animals and arthritic animals treated with ibandronate were found in any of the parameters assessed including leukocyte adherence, FCD, histology, and knee joint swelling. Conclusion: Ibandronate treatment of healthy mice was associated with an enhanced fraction of rolling leukocytes and increased numbers of extravasated leukocytes indicating a proinflammatory effect on the synovial microcirculation. In animals with a preexisting antigen-induced arthritis, however, ibandronate did not induce an exacerbation of joint inflammation and leukocyte adherence.</p> </body></html>
