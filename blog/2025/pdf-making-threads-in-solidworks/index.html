Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.2010”Design and construction of products is a complex development - research engineering activity of special importance, both for manufacturers and users. In modern manufacturing systems with automated production and automated design and construction of products and technological processes, the need for automated design and construction and automated selection of cutting tools exists. Hob milling is one of the most complex machining rocesses. It uses at the most in working of serration of spur wheels thanking to high productivity of the process. This paper contains automated calculation for a hob milling tool for serration of spur wheels, made using programming language Visual Basic. Based on this calculation, 3D model and technical documentation of the hob milling tool was created using software Pro/Engineer.”Generally the design resistance of welded connections can be evaluated using clasical analysis or Finite Element Method (FEM). Design of steel structures welded joints in detail are described in Euro Code 3 part 8. The method basically is fitted for applying classical methods, nevertheless using of FE method also is possible. In presented work the Finite Element code SolidWorks Simulation 2010 has been used to simulate behavior of statically loaded welded specimens and to determinate weld loads for evaluation of welded connections strength. Comparing the experimental results of welded relatively simple geometries specimens the FE models of welded connections has been validated. The comparison of the design resistance evaluation of welded connections simulated using 3D solid models and shell models are presented. Also using the weld loads calculated by FE 3D solid models the way of the design resistance evaluation of welded connection according the requirements of European Standard EN 1993-1-8 is discussed.IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering, 2019This paper describes the principles of the computerized system for creating geometric models of threaded joints with various geometric deviations, which arise during the thread turning, and demonstrates the use of these models to determine the dependencies of reliability indicators on these deviations by the finite element method. Using the developed system, based on Python and FreeCAD, axisymmetric finite element models of drilling tool joints and sucker rod couplings with deviations of the profile angle and the thread pitch were created and analyzed. Requirements for reliability of threaded connections of oil and gas equipment are constantly increasing. It is possible to determine the dependencies of reliability indicators on different geometric parameters by finite-element (FE) modeling of the stress-strain state [1-3]. But for conducting of such studies it is necessary to construct a parametric geometric model of a threaded connection. One of the main parameters that affects the reliability of threaded connections is their geometric accuracy. Geometric accuracy depends on the machining errors of thread turning (machine errors, load induced errors, thermal growth errors, error caused by tool wear and other errors). The purpose of this work is the development of the computerized system, which is designed to build models of threaded joints with various geometric deviations arising during the thread turning, and the demonstration of the use of these models to determine the dependencies of reliability indicators on these deviations. This rather complicated geometric problem can be solved with the help of modern geometric modeling kernels, in particular Open CASCADE Technology, on which FreeCAD is based. The computerized system being developed is based on the open-source software Python 2.7 and FreeCAD 0.17. Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. FreeCAD is a parametric 3D CAD based on Open CASCADE Technology 7.2.0 geometry kernel with Python API. Open CASCADE Technology is a software development kit intended for development of applications dealing with 3D CAD data. Note that if the FreeCAD capabilities for creating a model are not enough, you can use the PythonOCC library [4], in which the Open CASCADE kernel is fully available. The developed system has the ability to create the geometrical models of threads with different computational complexity and adequacy (Table ). The most adequate models for the FE simulation of the stress-strain state are 3D models with helical threads. But they have the highest computationalProceedings of the 2nd EAI International Conference on Management of Manufacturing Systems, 2018This article deals by the process of programming the production of external metric threads on outer cylindrical surfaces by means of the workshop programming for the Fanuc control system on the Leadwell T5 lathe. Described is the procedure of filling the windows for the geometric parameters needed to define the dimensions of the threaded groove and the tool. Further working windows for cutting conditions, spindle speed and tool feed rate.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2020Thread profiles can be considered as mechanical components which contributed to improving the evolution of machines and devices throughout all the history of man. The great importance of using threaded components, in industries and everyday life, is related to the versatility that allows the assembly and disassembly of components exceptionally quickly. Basically, since its invention, the threading tool has been developed, and its geometry has been optimised. Besides, new materials for tooling and coatings have been developed, allowing a significant evolution in the threading process. Thus, this article provides a review, demonstrating the evolution and the main studies in threading processes in the last 20 years, showing the main results obtained and the influence of threading in manufacturing processes. The traditional threading operations such as machining and forming tapping were contextualised, showing the main research with the advances generated in these processes. Furthermore, special internal threading processes were also revised, demonstrating the current developments and their gaps for new studies. Finally, based on this review are proposed lines of research, considering the shortcomings of the contemporary and revised works, that can increase the number of technical information for all threading processes, optimising the current way of making threads.Still studying.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014The application of thread milling is increasing in industry because of its inherent advantages over other thread cutting techniques. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of milling cutter tool geometry on cutting forces during thread milling. The proposed method can compare the performance of milling cutters in spite of the different number of tooth. The best thread milling cutter among the studied tools was determined from the cutting forces point of view. Furthermore, this study also pinpoints the best penetration strategy that provides minimum cutting forces. Lower cutting force variations will lead to fewer vibrations of the tool which in turn will produce accurate part.Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.</p> </body></html>
