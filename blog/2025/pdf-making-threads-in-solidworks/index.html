Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 2010Cigarette craving is an important contributor to cigarette smoking, and clinical approaches that focus on regulation of craving are effective in reducing rates of relapse. However, a laboratory model that targets the use of cognitive strategies to regulate craving is lacking. To develop such a model, twenty heavy cigarette smokers (&gt;12/day), twenty-two tobacco “chippers” (&lt;6/day), and twenty non-smoking controls completed this outpatient study, during which they were presented with photographs of cigarettes and foods that have been previously shown to induce craving. During each trial, participants were instructed to think of the stimulus in one of two ways: by focusing either on the short-term consequences associated with consuming the item (e.g., it will taste good) or on the long-term consequences associated with regular consumption (e.g., I may get lung cancer). Participants reported significantly reduced food cravings when focusing on the long-term consequences associated with eating. For cigarette-smoking participants, cigarette craving was significantly reduced when focusing on the long-term consequences associated with smoking. This latter finding confirms clinical data and extends it by highlighting the importance of cognition in the modulation of craving. Future studies using this laboratory model could test the efficacy of different cognitive strategies and develop targeted interventions for smoking cessation based on the regulation of craving.Journal of Interventional Cardiac Electrophysiology, 2023Background With advancements in technology and ablation techniques, catheter ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) has become safer with time. In the past, standard-of-care recommended overnight stay for outpatient procedures. As safety has improved and procedure times have shortened, some centers have allowed for same-day discharge. We report the results of a multi-center, randomized clinical trial investigating the safety of same-day discharge post-cryoballoon ablation. Methods Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation underwent pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) with the Medtronic Arctic Advance cryoballoon at 3 US centers. Six hours after the procedure, patients were randomized to either stay overnight or be discharged same day. Results A total of 49 patients were enrolled. Two patients were withdrawn prior to randomization. One patient chose to withdraw after randomization. Of the 22 patients randomized to same-day discharge and the 23 patients randomized the overnight stay, no significant adverse outcomes were reported in either group. Occurrence of adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups. Procedure time and fluoroscopy time did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusions This is the first randomized trial examining the safety of same-day discharge post-cryoballoon ablation. Based on our results, same-day discharge following cryoballoon ablation for paroxysmal AF is a safe option following uncomplicated ablation for PVI. Operators should use their discretion in selecting patients for same-day discharge.Micromachines, 2020We describe the manufacture of low-cost microfluidic systems to produce nanoscale liposomes with highly uniform size distributions (i.e., low polydispersity indexes (PDI)) and acceptable colloidal stability. This was achieved by exploiting a Y-junction device followed by a serpentine micromixer geometry to facilitate the diffusion between the mixing phases (i.e., continuous and dispersed) via advective processes. Two different geometries were studied. In the first one, the microchannels were engraved with a laser cutting machine on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) sheet and covered with another PMMA sheet to form a two-layer device. In the second one, microchannels were not engraved but through-hole cut on a PMMA sheet and encased by a top and a bottom PMMA sheet to form a three-layer device. The devices were tested out by putting in contact lipids dissolved in alcohol as the dispersed phase and water as the continuous phase to self-assemble the liposomes. By fixing the total flow r…European Heart Journal, 2002The objective of this paper is to measure the potential burden of cardiovascular disease within the original Framingham Heart Study cohort by transforming its welldescribed epidemiological measures into time-based health policy measures, such as life years lost to or lived with the disease. We constructed multi-state life tables of the Framingham Heart Study cohort to calculate dwelling times with a history of cardiovascular disease. Age-specific probabilities determined transitions from healthy through disease to death. For this synthetic cohort, from age 50 men (women) live on average 26 (32) years; 20 (26) free of cardiovascular disease. Allowing occupancy of more than one disease state, 50-year-old males (females) live 2•9 (1•2) years with a history of myocardial infarction, 0•93 (1•2) with a history of stroke, and 0•67 (0•93) with congestive heart failure. Having ever suffered acute myocardial infarction, stroke or congestive heart failure, life expectancy is reduced by 9 (13), 12 (15) or 16 ( ) years, respectively in 60-year-old men (women). Transforming occurrence probabilities into time-based health measures, the prevalence of cardiovascular disease is remarkable: from age 50, 20% of remaining life expectancy is lived with the disease. Such measures are integral to appropriate health planning and assessment of the potential population health value of various treatment and prevention strategies.Asian Journal of Current Research, 2025Lead exposure is a pervasive environmental hazard known for its detrimental effects on renal function. Garcinia kola is traditionally valued for its medicinal properties, and its extract is believed to protect organs from toxic insults by mitigating oxidative stress and cellular damage. This study investigates the nephroprotective effects of Garcinia kola (bitter kola) aqueous extract against lead-induced kidney damage in Wistar rats. Twenty-five male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: a control group, a lead-only group (60 mg/kg lead acetate), and three treated groups receiving lead followed by Garcinia kola extract at doses of 150 mg/kg, 300 mg/kg, and 600 mg/kg for 21 days. Biochemical analyses were conducted to assess serum urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels, alongside morphological assessments of kidney tissues. Results indicated that lead acetate administration significantly elevated serum creatinine levels (P = .001) and caused observable morphological changes, indicating renal impairment. Conversely, treatment with Garcinia kola extract resulted in a dose-dependent restoration of kidney function, with groups receiving 300 mg/kg and 600 mg/kg showing significant reductions in creatinine (P = .001, P = .011) and improvements in overall health metrics. These findings suggest that Garcinia kola extract effectively mitigates lead-induced renal damage, likely due to its antioxidant properties. This study highlights the potential of Garcinia kola as a therapeutic agent for protecting against heavy metal toxicity, warranting further investigation into its mechanisms of action and long-term efficacy in clinical settings.Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014is an open access repository that collects the work of Arts et Métiers ParisTech researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.

First, we motivate the problem and we create a publicly available annotated English corpus by crowdsourcing. Second, we propose a large set of features to predict the credibility of the answers. The features model the user, the answer, the question, the thread as a whole, and the interaction between them. Our experiments with ranking SVMs show that the credibility labels can be predicted with high performance according to several standard IR ranking metrics, thus supporting the potential usage of this layer of credibility information in practical applications. The features modeling the profile of the user (in particular trollness) turn out to be most important, but embedding features modeling the answer and the similarity between the question and the answer are also very relevant. Overall, half of the gap between the baseline performance and the perfect classifier can be covered using the proposed features.International series in management science/operations research, 1996Group the supplies and supply prices, respectively, into a column vector s ∈ R m and a column vector π ∈ R m . Similarly, group the demands and the demand prices, respectively, into a column vector d ∈ R n and a column vector ρ ∈ R n . Let Q ij denote the nonnegative commodity shipment between the supply and demand market pair (i, j) and let c ij denote the nonnegative unit transaction cost associated with trading the commodity between (i, j). Assume that the transaction cost includes the cost of transportation; depending upon the application, one may also include a tax/tariff, fee, duty, or subsidy within this cost. Group then the commodity shipments into a column vector Q ∈ R mn and the transaction costs into a column vector c ∈ R mn .Empowering minds: navigating the emerging clinical and mental health , 2025A Festschrift is a collection of scholarly works compiled to honor and recognise a scholar’s legacy and contributions. It serves as a mark of respect and appreciation for their impact on the field, often published on significant occasions like retirement, anniversaries, or milestones to celebrate individuals. This book, Empowering Minds: Navigating Emerging Clinical Mental Issues, is however, dedicated to the memory of Professor Jonathan Ohis Osiki, a renowned Clinical Psychologist whose scholarly works touched many lives. As a former Head of the Department of Counselling and Human Development Studies at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, Jonathan Osiki’s contributions were widely acknowledged. Having had the privilege of knowing and relating with him as a classmate and later as a colleague in the Department, I believe his memory should be preserved for those who knew him and for others. This book therefore, is fittingly in order. The theme and chapters also align with his passion for clinical issues in Counselling Psychology, addressing contemporary mental health concerns and sparking meaningful discussions. I trust this book will make a valuable contribution to the field he cherished, and honouring Professor Osiki’s memory and impact.Reports of Practical Oncology &amp; Radiotherapy, 2016reports of practical oncology and radiotherapy 2 1 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 95-101 combination with (p,n) and (d,n) reactions. 9 Be(d,n) 10 B at 1.4 MeV, with a thin target has been shown to be a realistic option for the treatment of deep-seated lesions.Jurnal, 2026</p> </body></html>
