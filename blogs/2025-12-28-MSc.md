## Project Overview

Several medical devices can directly analyze a patient’s medical condition; however, the physical presence of non-critical patients places a significant burden on hospital infrastructure, particularly bed availability. This issue becomes more critical during movement-restricted situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

This project presents a **budget-friendly, IoT-based distanced health monitoring system** that enables continuous monitoring of non-critical patients without requiring physical hospital visits. The system provides real-time access to medical data for patients, caretakers, and doctors through a secure web application.

</div>

The system collects physiological data from patients using sensors connected to a **Raspberry Pi**. The processed data are transmitted securely to **Firebase Firestore**, enabling near real-time synchronization with the Medical Instrumentation System (MIS) web application.

The web interface allows:

- Patients and caretakers to monitor real-time health parameters and danger levels
- Doctors to review medical history and provide prescriptions and feedback remotely

---

## Scope and Objectives

- Develop an **IoT-based system** for monitoring patient health
- Monitor **physiological parameters and lifestyle indicators**
- Design a **portable device** suitable for continuous patient use
- Enable scalability for **multiple patients and doctors**

---

The developed Medical Instrumentation System (MIS) demonstrated that IoT-based distanced patient monitoring is feasible for non-critical cases.

Key outcomes include:

- End-to-end data synchronization (device → Firestore → MIS page) within **1–2 seconds**
- Patients and caretakers can view medical data, danger levels, and follow doctor prescriptions
- Secure storage of patient medical history enables informed clinical decision-making

This study incorporates patient basic details to prioritize medical history, an aspect not widely explored in related works. Additionally, the system supports doctor prescriptions and feedback, which are absent in many existing solutions.

Firestore allows up to **1 MB of data per document**, indicating the need for a dedicated database server during large-scale commercialization. An SMS gateway can be integrated for OTP-based authentication to enhance system security.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a feasible and scalable approach to implementing an **IoT-based distanced health monitoring system**. The MIS web application successfully displays medical data received from distributed devices and supports interactions among multiple patients, caretakers, and doctors.

---

## Future Directions

- Integrate additional medical devices and sensors based on specific health conditions
- Incorporate **Machine Learning/Deep Learning** models for early warning prediction
- Enhance security using **SMS-based OTP authentication**
