I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Georgia, where I focus on advanced agricultural robotics, automation, and intelligent sensing technologies for sustainable farming. My research integrates machine vision, robotic manipulation, and field-scale experimentation to develop innovative solutions that enhance agricultural productivity and reduce labor dependency.

Previously, I served as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University, where I gained strong expertise in agricultural systems, precision agriculture, and applied engineering research. I am passionate about applying engineering innovation to solve real-world agricultural challenges and contributing to the future of smart, autonomous farming.
