I am a Graduate Research Assistant in the School of Environmental, Civil, Agricultural, and Mechanical Engineering at the University of Georgia, where I work on agricultural robotics, automation, and intelligent sensing technologies to support sustainable farming. My research combines machine vision, robotic manipulation, and real-world field experiments to create practical systems that improve farm efficiency and reduce manual labor.

Previously, I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering at Mississippi State University. During this time, I developed a strong foundation in agricultural engineering, precision agriculture, and applied research methods. These experiences shaped my interest in building engineering solutions that can be tested and used in real agricultural environments.

My research interests include autonomous field robots, computer vision, sensor-based decision systems, and robotic end-effectors for selective harvesting. I am especially interested in developing systems that are reliable in outdoor conditions and can be adopted by farmers to improve productivity and sustainability.
