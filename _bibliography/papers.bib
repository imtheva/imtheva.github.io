  abstract={Intensification of livestock production systems is mainly driven by increasing population and subsequent increase in food demand. Major challenges of an intensified system are monitoring of a large number of animals, fast disease spread, frequent monitoring of health status, scarcity of labor, and optimizing the resources to maximize the profit. Different modern technologies are used to overcome these challenges; computer vision and image analysis techniques are the primary ones. The computer vision approach has gained prominence in contemporary livestock farming and has become an essential component of the farming system in many developed nations. This chapter provides insights into various applications of computer vision and image processing technologies (tracking of individual animals, health and disease monitoring, body size and weight measurement, and analysis of milk and meat quality), limitations, research gaps, and future prospects. This technology reduces labor requirements, eases management, is more precise in monitoring, and acts as a supporting tool for decision-making. However, the need for substantial initial capital, technical knowledge, regular monitoring, breed or strain-specific calibrations, and selection of correct features are identified as challenges of this technology. Lacks automation in computer vision technology, inadequate application of artificial intelligence in thermal imaging, identifying the optimum features for detection of lameness and lack of user-friendly applications are a few identified research gaps. Although computer vision has been implemented in livestock farming, it is still at the intermediate level and the identified challenges and research gaps need to be addressed through research and development for full-fledged automated livestock management.},

  abstract={Traffic signs are essential for road safety, guiding and informing drivers about rules and conditions. Ignoring signs or traffic rules can lead to accidents, causing property damage, and even deaths. To ensure safety, drivers must remain aware of traffic signs, obey their instructions, and drive responsibly. Notably, Sri Lanka has unique traffic signs compared to other countries. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based traffic sign alert system with good accuracy and efficiency in traffic sign recognition and enhance driver awareness by integrating an auditory alert system. This alert system was implemented under two main sections: object detection system and auditory alert system. The traffic signs dataset images were labeled and pre-processed using the Roboflow software tool. The You Only Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) model was used to train the system, which allowed it to understand complicated patterns and attributes associated with 15 different sign classes. To improve driver awareness, an auditory alert system was developed using the PyDub library to generate real-time alerts in the form of voice messages. These alerts are triggered whenever a traffic sign is detected, giving an additional layer of information to the driver. On the test dataset, the integrated and fine-tuned YOLOv5 model achieved the F1 score of 90.09% and mean average precision (mAP) of 87.55% resulting in good evaluation metrics values for detection. This YOLOv5 model-based traffic sign auditory alert system was highly effective and efficient in increasing driver awareness and also helped to reduce road accidents.},

  abstract={Cotton is a major cash crop in the United States, with the country being a leading global producer and exporter. Nearly all U.S. cotton is grown in the Cotton Belt, spanning 17 states in the southern region. Harvesting remains a critical yet challenging stage, impacted by the use of costly, environmentally harmful defoliants and heavy, expensive cotton pickers. These factors contribute to yield loss, reduced fiber quality, and soil compaction, which collectively threaten long-term sustainability. To address these issues, this study proposes a lightweight, small-scale, vision-guided autonomous robotic cotton picker as an alternative. An autonomous system, built on Clearpath’s Husky platform and integrated with the Cotton-Eye perception system, was developed and tested in the Gazebo simulation environment. A virtual cotton field was designed to facilitate autonomous navigation testing. The navigation system used Global Positioning System (GPS) and map-based guidance, assisted by an RGB-depth camera and a YOLOv8n-seg instance segmentation model. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 85.2%, recall of 88.9%, and precision of 93.0%. The GPS-based approach reached a 100% completion rate (CR) within a (5e-6)° threshold, while the map-based method achieved a 96.7% CR within a 0.25 m threshold. The developed Robot Operating System (ROS) packages enable robust simulation of autonomous cotton picking, offering a scalable baseline for future agricultural robotics. CottonSim code and datasets are publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/imtheva/CottonSim},
