Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.Journal of Mining and Metallurgy, Section B, 2017Journal of Scientific Research, 2017An initiative has been taken to investigate the trends in discharge and water level (WL) of the Surma River in northeastern Bangladesh. The daily time series data of discharge and WL from two stations named Kanairghat and Sylhet with a period of 42 years (1973 -2014) and 35 years (1980 -2014) respectively have been analyzed. Non parametric Mann-Kendall Test has been applied to detect the trend and Sen’s slope estimator is used to measure the slope of the trends. In Kanairghat station, annual mean WL has significant trend (P: 0.03); while, annual mean discharge, mean monsoon discharge, annual maximum discharge, mean monsoon WL, and annual maximum WL shows insignificant trend (P: 0.24, 0.46, 0.14, 0.05, and 0.12). In Sylhet station, annual mean discharge, annual maximum discharge, and annual mean WL have significant trend (P: 0.03, 0.004, and 0.02). On the other hand, mean monsoon discharge, mean monsoon WL, and annual maximum WL in Sylhet station has insignificant trend (P: 0.46, 0.13, and 0.21). According to Sen’s slope statistics, all of the detected trends, except annual maximum WL at Sylhet station, are downward. This study recommends a comprehensive water management scheme should be taken to ensure sustainable use of the river water.Nigerian Journal of Technological Development, 2018Law Reform, 2017Jurnal Kimia Sains dan Aplikasi, 2013Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014is an open access repository that collects the work of Arts et Métiers ParisTech researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.

Ahmed el-Kurtubî (ö. 671/1273), tefsir geleneğinin önemli isimleri arasında yer alır. Hareketli yaşamı ve pek çok ilimle meşguliyeti sebebiyle tefsirinin kendine has bir niteliğe sahip olduğu görülür. Özellikle hayatının bir dönemini geçirdiği Endülüs toprakları ve bu topraklardan miras aldığı nitelikler onu müstesna bir konuma yerleştirir. Bir Malikî olarak tefsirinde fıkıh yönü öne çıksa da eseri ahkam tefsirlerinin sınırlarını aşan bir yapıya sahiptir. Ayetleri değerlendirirken yeri geldikçe dilbilime, kıraate, fıkha ve hadislere yer vermekle birlikte kuşatıcı yorumlara ulaşmayı da ihmal etmez. İslam inancında peygamberliğin ve peygamberlerin önemi büyüktür. Bu bakımdan İslam düşünce tarihinin önemli meselelerinden biri de peygamberlik ve peygamberler olmuştur. Kur’an ayetlerinde peygamberlik mefhumunun gündeme geldiği ve dinin insanlara arzında peygamberlerin öneminden bahsedildiği görülür. Ayetlerde gönderilen peygamberlerin özelliklerinden de söz edilir. Bu bakımdan Hz. Peygamber’in yaşadığı olaylar ve bu olaylara verdiği tepkiler de ayetlerde yer alır. Ayetlerde insanlara vahyi bildirmek üzere görevlendirilen Elçi’yi destekleyen ve ona güç veren ifadelerin yanı sıra kimi durumlarda onu uyaran ve ona görevini hatırlatan beyanlar da zikredilir. Hz. Peygamber’e yönelik uyarı ifadelerini içeren ayetlere bakıldığında kimi zaman gerçekleşen bir olayla kimi zaman ise henüz gerçekleşmemiş fakat dikkat çekilmek istenen bir konuyla alakalı beyanlar dikkat çeker. İfadeler bazen müşfik bir dili öne çıkartırken bazen de tehdit yönü ağır basan lafızlara yer verir. Peygamberlik vazifesiyle doğrudan ilgili meseleler uyarılarda öne çıktığı gibi Hz. Peygamber’in örnek şahsiyeti çerçevesinde değer bulan konular da zikredilebilir. Müfessir Kurtubî tefsirinde Hz. Peygamber’e yönelik uyarı ifadelerinin yer aldığı ayetleri değerlendirir. İlgili ayetleri tefsir ederken ayetlerin nüzul sebeplerine işaret ederek nüzul ortamını anlatmaya özen gösterir. Uyarı ifadelerinin öncelikli muhatabı ile dolaylı yönden hitap ettiği kimseleri beyan eder. Çalışmada Hz. Peygamber’e yönelik uyarı ifadelerinin yer aldığı ayetlerin Kurtubî Tefsiri’ndeki değerlendirmesi üzerinde durulacaktır. Müfessirin genel tefsir temayülünü yansıtan yorumlarının yanı sıra farklı değerlendirmelere kapı aralayacak beyanları da arz edilecektir. Böylece bir ahkam tefsiri örneği olarak Kurtubî Tefsiri’nin konuyla ilgili değerlendirmelerinin tefsir disiplini içindeki yeri ortaya konulacaktır. İlgili yorumların konuyla alakalı değerlendirmeleri zenginleştirmesi beklenmektedir.Journal of Biomechanics, 2010The knowledge of articular cartilage contact biomechanics in the knee joint is important for understanding the joint function and cartilage pathology. However, the in-vivo tibiofemoral articular cartilage contact biomechanics during gait remains unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo tibiofemoral cartilage contact biomechanics during the stance phase of treadmill gait. Eight healthy knees were magnetic resonance (MR) scanned and imaged with a dual fluoroscopic system during gait on a treadmill. The tibia, femur and associated cartilage were constructed from the MR images and combined with the dual fluoroscopic images to determine in vivo cartilage contact deformation during the stance phase of gait. Throughout the stance phase of gait, the magnitude of peak compartmental contact deformation ranged between 7% and 23% of the resting cartilage thickness and occurred at regions with thicker cartilage. Its excursions in the anteroposterior direction were greater in the medial tibiofemoral compartment as compared to those in the lateral compartment. The contact areas throughout the stance phase were greater in the medial compartment than in the lateral compartment. The information on in vivo tibiofemoral cartilage contact biomechanics during gait could be used to provide physiological boundaries for in vitro testing of cartilage. Also, the data on location and magnitude of deformation among non-diseased knees during gait could identify where loading and later injury might occur in diseased knees.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Making Threads in SolidWorks]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">(PDF) Measuring Pen – A digital device to measure distance</title><link href="https://imtheva.github.io/blog/2025/pdf-measuring-pen-a-digital-device-to-measure-distance/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="(PDF) Measuring Pen – A digital device to measure distance"/><published>2025-12-19T19:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2025-12-19T19:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://imtheva.github.io/blog/2025/pdf-measuring-pen--a-digital-device-to-measure-distance</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://imtheva.github.io/blog/2025/pdf-measuring-pen-a-digital-device-to-measure-distance/"><![CDATA[<p>OutlineDownload Free PDF…3 pagesThis is a new approach on the section of measurement. Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Journal of the Indonesian Tropical Animal Agriculture, 2019Journal of Scientific Research, 2019Six new bis-azo disperse dyes were synthesized by linking various aryl amino and hydroxyl derivatives to 4-methoxy-2-nitroaniline and 6-amino-2,4-dihydroxypyrimidine moieties through diazo coupling reactions. The structures of the bis-azo dyes were identified by Fourier transform infrared, proton and carbon 13 nuclear magnetic resonance data. The prepared dyestuffs were applied onto polyester and nylon 6 fabrics and subsequently their fastness properties in terms of light, washing, sublimation and rubbing were determined. Compared with the light fastness of polyester fabrics, the light fastness of the dyed nylon 6 fabrics were slightly lower. The technical performance of the dyes on the two textile substrates used for the study, demonstrated their useful applications in the dyeing of synthetic fibres.Applied Sciences, 2021Ultrasmall nanoparticles are potential candidates for application as high-performance imaging agents. Herein, we present the synthesis and characterization of folic acid (FA)-conjugated polyacrylic acid (PAA)-coated MnO nanoparticles with an average particle diameter of 2.7 nm. FA conferred cancer-targeting ability, while PAA conferred good colloidal stability and low cellular cytotoxicity on the FA-PAA-coated MnO nanoparticles. Further, the nanoparticles exhibited a high relaxivity (r1) value of 9.3 s−1mM−1 (r2/r1 = 2.2). Their application potential as cancer-targeting T1 magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents was confirmed by their enhanced T1 contrast enhancements at the brain cancer (U87MG) site upon intravenous administration to mice tails.Urology, 2015To determine the extent, severity, and sex differences of psychosocial deficits in men and women with urologic chronic pelvic pain syndromes (UCPPS), which in the past have been considered separate bladder (interstitial cystitis-painful bladder syndrome) and prostate (chronic prostatitis-chronic pelvic pain syndrome) disorders. Evaluations of men and women separately suggest UCPPS is associated with increased anxiety and depression. However, studies directly testing deficits in broader psychosocial domains such as cognitive processes, intimate relationships, and trauma history, or tests of sex differences in the pattern of difficulties associated with UCPPS have not been performed. A total of 233 female and 191 male UCPPS patients and 235 female and 182 male healthy controls (HCs) were recruited from 6 academic medical centers in the United States and evaluated with a comprehensive battery of symptom, psychosocial, and illness impact measures.

Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.Chemical Physics, 1999Ilmu Kelautan : Indonesian Journal of Marine Sciences, 2017Jurnal Udayana Mengabdi, 2019Jurnal Udayana Mengabdi, 2019</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a new approach on the section of measurement.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.

You just need to surround your math expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$ E = mc^2 $$</code>. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like \(E = mc^2\).</p> <p>To use display mode, again surround your expression with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:</p> \[\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2\] <p>You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\begin{equation}...\end{equation}</code> instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$</code> for display mode math. MathJax will automatically number equations:</p> <p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:cauchy-schwarz} \left( \sum<em>{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum</em>{k=1}^n a<em>k^2 \right) \left( \sum</em>{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) \end{equation}</p> <p>and by adding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\label{...}</code> inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the
