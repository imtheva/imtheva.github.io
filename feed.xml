Computer-aided design (CAD) of jigs and fixtures is an effective solution in this direction. The current paper focuses on a computer-aided design of the traditional jigs and fixtures and developed a system containing tailor-made software, created using the Visual Basic programming language and installed on it the viewer screen to show the part. The developed system has been built by connecting Visual Basic programming language to the SolidWorks software on which the part is drawn and saved as STEP AP-203 file format, and the system reads and extracts the data from the STEP AP-203 file. Heuristic rules of feature recognition are pre-prepared for checking the extracted geometric data and deciding which data shape will represent the machining feature; then, the system provides the optimum design of the traditional jigs and fixtures for a group of hollow cylindrical parts that contain a group of cross-holes on the cylinder body, whether perpendicular or offset from the cylinder’s axis, (inclined or inclined offset, or blind or through, by applying pre-prepared heuristic rules for the design of traditional jigs and fixtures.2023 IEEE 17th International Symposium on Applied Computational Intelligence and Informatics (SACI), 2023In this paper, a carpenter software is designed and implemented that supports the daily management processes (customers, orders, inventory) and generates a pattern from the product descriptions based on the parameters specified. During the pattern generation process, a two-dimensional optimization is performed to generate a pattern that includes horizontal or vertical cuts, depending on the target machine, on which the position of the required parts is placed, generates the smallest material loss and uses leftover materials from the past. From the application, the pattern can be viewed and extracted online or in PDF format. This all is implemented in a layered web application with a modern approach.THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELING AND LOADING SIMULATION OF A STANDARD THREADED FASTENER IN CAD ENVIRONMENT (ТРИМЕРНО МОДЕЛИРАНЕ И СИМУЛАЦИОННО НАТОВАРВАНЕ В CAD-СРЕДА KНА СТАНДАРТНО РЕЗБОВО СЪЕДИНЕНИЕ ), 2006Abstract. The techniques of correct three dimensional modeling of geometry parameters of thread and of the body of standard threaded fasteners (bolt and nut) in CAD environment of software product SolidWoprks’2005 are presented. The model of joint are put under loading simulation and the zones of concentrations of stresses are determined. The values and distribution of stresses from loading simulation and from calculation and from experiments known from literature are compared. Key words: threaded fasteners, CAD, finite element method.This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rZenodo (CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research), 2012Modular fixtures (MFs) are very important tools in manufacturing processes in terms of reduction the cost and the production time. This paper introduces an automated approach for assembling MFs elements by employing SolidWorks as a powerful 3D CAD software. Visual Basic (VB) programming language was applied integrating with SolidWorks API (Application programming interface) functions. This integration allowed creating plug-in file and generating new menus in the SolidWorks environment. The menus allow the user to select, insert, and assemble MFs elements.บทความวิจัย รายงานการวิจัยในชั้นเรียน การพัฒนาความสามารถในการแก้ปัญหาฟิสิกส์และการเรียนรู้ค าศัพท์ วิทยาศาสตร์ภาษาอังกฤษ เรื่อง ไฟฟ้าฟ้าสถิต ของนักเรียนชั้นมัธยมศึกษาปีที่ 5 โรงเรียนสตูลวิทยา ที่ได้รับการจัดการเรียนรู้ แบบสืบเสาะหาความรู้ 7E ร่วมกับกระบวนการคิดเชิงเมตาคอกนิชัน2011Background: Patients with non ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) present with diverse clinical, electrocardiographic, cardiac biomarker, echocardiographic and angiographic characteristics.

Within the complex realm of epigenetic modifications, hydroxymethylation emerges as a crucial factor in orchestrating mechanisms for neuroprotection and repair following such injuries. This review consolidates current research on the multifaceted role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in regulating molecular and cellular processes vital for neuronal survival and regeneration after cerebrovascular injury. The discussion delves into the dynamic interaction between hydroxymethylation and important pathways in neuroprotection, such as the modulation of excitotoxicity and cellular metabolism, resolution of inflammation, and mitigation of oxidative stress. Additionally, it explores emerging evidence suggesting that 5hmC contributes to neurorepair by promoting neurogenesis, axonal regeneration, angiogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. Understanding the role of hydroxymethylation in cerebrovascular injury provides insights into potential therapeutic approaches for enhancing the brain’s innate mechanisms for protection and repair. By elucidating the intricate involvement of 5hmC in these injuries, this review establishes a basis for further research aimed at leveraging its therapeutic potential to alleviate neurological deficits and promote recovery in affected individuals.2014Procedia Manufacturing, 2015The modulated tool path (MTP) chip breaking process has been modified to improve chip management capabilities and to prevent large chip nest accumulations commonly encountered in threading operations. The use of MTP to create segmented chips requires a different approach for threading operations than for normal MTP turning operations, although the fundamental principal is the same. The primary difference between MTP for threading and for straight turning is that the part surface that the tool repeatedly engages and disengages, during the modulation process, is the thread root rather than the cut face. The threading MTP part program developed in this paper is capable of machining a thread with the desired lead, depth, undercut angle, and taper angle while also producing segmented chips.International Journal of …, 2006This paper presents a mechanistic model for prediction of the thread milling forces. The mechanics of cutting for thread milling is analyzed similar to the end milling process but with modified cutting edge geometry. The chip thickness and cutting force models are developed considering the unique geometry of the tool. The model has been calibrated for 6061 Aluminum and validated. The effects of tool and thread geometry have been studied using the model. rVariations in cutting forces were investigated experimentally depending on infeed angles and cutting areas in the external threading on a CNC turning centre. For this purpose, AISI 1050 workpiece material, 16ERM AG 60 IC 908 cutting tool, and SER 2525 M16 tool holder were used. External threading operations were performed using 0 • , 14.5 • , 15 • , 27.5 • , and 30 • infeed angles while the cutting speed was held constant at 100 m/min for the experiments. Experimental results showed that the infeed angle and cutting area had significant effects on the main cutting force and the radial force components were considerable in threading operations in terms of energy consumption. In addition, the optimum infeed angle was 30 • in the external threading operations in terms of cutting forces.Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 2014Different tool geometries have been developed by leading companies in the tool industry to different aims of application. The fastest progress can be observed in the development of coatings, in spite of this it can be noticed that there are only few coating types, but they can be used in a wide range. For users it offers the great advantage to select appropriate tool easier. Coating types, developed specially to individual aim of application, offer much better solution, compared to the generally used coating types. Platit AG, dealing with the development of optimised coating types, has requested our specialised group to carry out tests on specialised coating types. Our present study is going to summarise the results of the tests, carried out with thread forming tools.The International Journal of Advanced Manufacturing Technology, 2014is an open access repository that collects the work of Arts et Métiers ParisTech researchers and makes it freely available over the web where possible.

METHODS. C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized, and three repeated volumetric images were acquired in both eyes with SD-OCT (250 A-scans ϫ 250 frames ϫ 1024 samplings), centered on the optic nerve head (ONH). The mice were repositioned between scans. TRT was automatically measured within a sampling band of retinal thickness with radii of 55 to 70 pixels, centered on the ONH by using custom segmentation software. The first volumetric image acquired in a given eye was used to register the remaining two SD-OCT images by manually aligning the en face images with respect to rotation and linear translation. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to global and quadrant thicknesses, taking into account the clustering between eyes, to assess imprecision (measurement reproducibility). RESULTS. Twenty-six eyes of 13 adult mice (age 13 weeks) were imaged. The mean global TRT across all eyes was 298.21 m, with a mouse heterogeneity standard deviation (SD) of 4.88 m (coefficient of variation [CV] ϭ 0.016), an eye SD of 3.32 m (CV ϭ 0.011), and a device-related imprecision SD of 2.33 m (CV ϭ 0.008). The superior quadrant had the thickest mean TRT measurement (310.38 m) and the highest (worst) imprecision SD (3.13 m; CV ϭ 0.010), and the inferior quadrant had the thinnest mean TRT (291.55 m). The quadrant with the lowest (best) imprecision SD was in the nasal one (2.06 m; CV ϭ 0.007). CONCLUSIONS. Good reproducibility was observed for SD-OCT retinal thickness measurements in mice. SD-OCT may be useful for in vivo longitudinal studies in mice.

Today, most of the garment companies are producing lot of clothes. While producing clothes they have to face lot of problems. For an example time of delivery and accuracy in clothes size. A traditional way of measuring a cloth is using a tape. Due to that there may be errors in measuring length and it take times time to check the length using tape. Main aim of this mini project is to solve these problems using a microcontroller measuring system. This will reduce the time taken for the cutting and will measure accurately. For this project Arduino Nano is used as the microcontroller for performing the algorithmic work.Protein &amp; Peptide Letters, 2010In insects numerous physiological processes are regulated by neuropeptides. Two fluorescent analogues of the amino acids tryptophan and tyrosine were synthesized and incorporated in the diuretic neuropeptide helicokinin I from the moth Heliothis zea. By fluorescence emission measurements it was shown that both fluorescent helicokinin I analogues react sensitive on the dielectricity of their microenvironment. A helicokinin I analogue containing the fluorescent tryptophan mimic -[6’-(N,N-dimethyl)-amino-2’-naphthoyl]alanine (Ald) was shown to bind to dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles by the Ald residue. A membrane binding model for helicokinin I is proposed based on data from related mammalian and insect-neuropeptides.2013Bibliografía recomendada para el Tema: 3.2.-Moléculas diatómicas.

The aim of the present work was to investigate the principle of non-Newtonian capillary rheometry for quality control purposes. In the investigation, three series of acrylic-based viscoelastic coating samples with different types and concentrations of pigments and thickening agents were used, and the rheological measurements were compared to results obtained with the so-called Stormer viscometer and an advanced off-line rheometer. A detailed analysis of the potential measurement implications was also conducted. For shear stresses from 15.0 to 350.0 Pa (the upper boundary), the novel capillary rheometer was found to provide results in good quantitative agreement with the advanced rheometer when sample holding time, and thereby shear history, was properly controlled. At a shear stress between 1.0 Pa (lower boundary) and 15.0 Pa, the agreement was less good, with a difference in results of the non-Newtonian capillary rheometer and the advanced rheometer between 15 and 74 %. The resolution of the capillary rheometer was sufficiently high to allow detection of the rheology changes associated with variations in coating formulations of pigment volume and rheology modifier concentrations. In summary, for fast on-line evaluation of coating rheology, the principle of capillarity has been demonstrated to be a varied and robust technique.Heavy -y- Metal. Vol. 1: A través del cristal. Nuevas perspectivas culturales, 2019Autenticidad. Concepto central para la cultura urbana, aunque al mismo tiempo uno de los más ambiguos y subjetivos de cuantos contribuyen a construir sus respectivos discursos musicales. Reclamada, exigida, defendida, pero también vilipendiada, la autenticidad es una de las grandes protagonistas del código subcultural del heavy metal, alrededor de la cual se establecen toda una serie de relaciones básicas entre creadores, seguidores, sociedad e industria que posibilitan el desarrollo de la escena. Ahora bien, ¿qué factores están implicados en su definición? ¿Cómo se articulan los procesos que ayudan a determinar qué y quién es más y/o menos auténtico? ¿Es la autenticidad un concepto estático, o dinámico? ¿Cómo ha influido en la evolución del heavy metal en tanto fenómeno sociocultural y comercial? ¿Qué problemática intrínseca tiene? Después de cuarenta años, e inmersos en pleno siglo XXI, se antoja necesaria una revisión profunda de sus parámetros, y abrir la puerta de esta manera a un debate que ayude a redefinir o reafirmar sus términos dentro de una sociedad y un mercado que han experimentado profundos y significativos cambios.Dental Press Journal of Orthodontics, 2017Objective: the objective of the study was to determine the relationship between dental calcification stages and skeletal maturation in a Peruvian sample. Methods: panoramic, cephalometric and carpal radiographs of 78 patients (34 girls and 44 boys) between 7 and 17 years old (9.90 ± 2.5 years) were evaluated. Stages of tooth calcification of the mandibular canine, first premolar, second premolar, and second molar and the skeletal maturation with a hand-wrist and a cervical vertebrae method were assessed. The relationships between the stages were assessed using Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Additionally, the associations of mandibular and pubertal growth peak stages with tooth calcification were evaluated by Fisher’s exact test. Results: all teeth showed positive and statistically significant correlations, the highest correlation was between the mandibular second molar calcification stages with hand-wrist maturation stages (r = 0.758, p &lt; 0.001) and with vertebrae cervical m…EFFECTS OF HYPERTENSION AND ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION ON MALE INFERTILITY- INTERGRATIVE REVIEW, 2023ABSTRACT Introduction It is estimated that 1.28 billion adults aged between 30 to 70 years worldwide have hypertension and two thirds of these live in the low and middle-income countries. Hypertension is a leading preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature deaths. Hypertension and anti-hypertensive have been associated with decreased semen volume, sperm count, motility, abnormal sperm morphology and erectile dysfunction. Consequently, hypertension and anti-hypertensives contribute to male infertility. Male infertility contributes over 50% of the cases of infertility amongst couples and studies have shown that male infertility increases with 0.3% annually. Methods This is an integrative literature review on published articles. Purposeful sampling was used. Relevant data from PubMed, Medline, Google scholar, Cochrane and ResearchGate was searched, evaluated for its relevance and reviewed. Further, grey literature was reviewed and the search was done in English. Owing to the scarcity of the research data in this field, the search went as far back as 20 years ago. Results The search strategy yielded a grand total of 99,434 electronic citations from the years 2003 to 2023, a period of 20 years. 112 study papers were included and scrutinized in the integrative literature review and thematic data analysis was done on effects of hypertension and the antihypertensive drugs on male fertility. Conclusion Men with hypertension have a higher risk of experiencing fertility problems than men without hypertension. Studies have also found that the use of certain antihypertensive medications negatively affects sperm quality, volume and motility and consequently, male fertility. Antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men should be based on the individual’s overall health and his reproductive health needs. Lifestyle modifications are beneficial for men with hypertension who are trying to conceive through medical interventions as compared to surgical interventions.Still studying.— This paper deals with the design and implementation of a simple HMC6352 2-axis digital compass. Most compasses have been of the analogue type with magnetic needles as pointers. Replacing the “ old “ magnetic needle compass or the gyrocompass by an electronic solution offers advantages like having a solid-state component without moving parts and the ease of interfacing with other electronic systems. In this work, the aim is to design and implement a digital compass. To realize this, we made use of HMC6352 which is a 2-axis MR (magneto-resistive) sensor from Honeywell, Arduino Uno board with an onboard ATmega328 microcontroller chip, and a 16x2 character Liquid Crystal Display (LCD).We adopted the magneto-resistive (MR) technology as compared to flux-gate sensors common in most electronic compasses which has the disadvantage of making the device bulky. The trial test carried out with the completed HMC6352 digital compass showed a reading of 232.8 degrees West indicating its effectiveness in direction finding.2013S83 Correspondence to: Uthaisang-Tanechpongtamb W, Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Srinakharinwirot University, 114 Sukhumvit 23, Wattana, Bangkok 10110, Thailand.

Linear and volumetric measurements were performed on 117 specimens (test diameter &gt; 40 mm) and the ratios between them were analyzed along with Aristotle’s lantern weight participation (AL index). The potential model was tested between AL wet weight and tooth height (log data), estimating the coefficients by linear regression. Echinoid specimens from Pituba (<italic>n</italic> = 57) manifested a higher average degree of sphericity and test thickness. Proportionally, this population also showed higher AL and tooth height, indicating that the dimensions of this structure exhibit particularities in the spatial arrangement along the oral-aboral axis of the echinoids. Negative allometric relationships (β &lt; 1) were observed in all specimens. The environments with distinct characteristics and wide food availability associated with a broad spectrum of the trophic niche occupied by the populations point out modulations and specializations of morphofunctional strategies and the expression of phenotypes.Academia Oncology, 2024Introduction: Endometrial adenocarcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy in the United States. Between 10% and 30% of endometrial adenocarcinomas exhibit microsatellite instability (MSI), a genetic hypermutability that results from an impaired DNA mismatch repair (MMR). MSI can be indirectly identified by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for deficient MMR protein expression and may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The microcystic, elongated, and fragmented (MELF) pattern of invasion can be identified on histologic review and has also been associated with adverse clinical outcomes. It is unknown whether this phenotype of invasion is associated with MSI, and to date, no studies have correlated MMR status and MELF-pattern invasion in endometrial adenocarcinoma. In this study, we examine the correlation between these factors. Methods: We performed an IRB-approved, retrospective review of medical records and pathology slides of surgical cases of endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma between January 2016 and January 2020. Results: MMR mutations were present in 35%, MELF-pattern invasion was present in 29%, and both factors were present in 9.4% of specimens. We did not demonstrate a correlation between MMR mutation status and the presence of MELF-pattern invasion (<italic>p</italic> = 0.15). Conclusions: Our study did not demonstrate a relationship between MMR status and the presence of MELF-pattern invasion. MSI instability may not play a role in the pathogenesis of MELF-pattern invasion. Future study into the association between MELF-pattern invasion and other genetic mutations that arise within endometrial adenocarcinoma is warranted.International journal of Sociologies and Anthropologies Science reviews, 2024Background and Aims: Currently, in China nursing graduates of higher vocational colleges are restricted by many factors, particularly career development. Career development is an important indicator for measuring the quality of nursing graduates and the extent to which government and hospitals attach importance to the employment of nursing graduates in higher vocational colleges. Therefore, it is necessary to delve into the career development of nursing graduates in vocational colleges under the current employment situation. This study mainly aimed to investigate the current situation of nursing graduates’ career development and factors affecting the career development of nursing graduates. Materials and Methods: The sample was drawn from the 2019 nursing graduates in Weifang Nursing Vocational College using non-random sampling. These nursing graduates participated in the research voluntarily participation and accepted their participation in the research consent form. Data were collected using a questionnaire. The questions focused on many factors that affected their career development, including how hiring practices at government, hospitals, and colleges, factors affecting the recruitment process, and challenges facing career development. Results: The results show that nursing graduates have basic knowledge and skills in nursing. The results also showed that government employment policies, teaching program management, and employability development were the key factors influencing the career development of nursing graduates from higher vocational colleges are relatively successful. Additionally, results indicated that school-based classroom environments have a significant and positive impact on nursing graduates’ career development. The government should increase employment efficiency and change employment policies as necessary to achieve sustainable professional development. Educational institutions and nursing schools should improve their teaching and learning management systems to align with employment policies and needs. Conclusion: The results emphasize how crucial it is for the government to get involved in employment policy optimization to promote the nursing profession’s long-term growth. In addition, educational establishments need to modify their pedagogical approaches to better prepare nursing graduates for the skills required by changing job markets and facilitate a smooth entry into the workforce.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a new approach on the section of measurement.

In December, we launched our first natively multimodal model Gemini 1.0 in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Just a few months later we released 1.5 Pro, with enhanced performance and a breakthrough long context window of 1 million tokens.Developers and enterprise customers have been putting 1.5 Pro to use in incredible ways and finding its long context window, multimodal reasoning capabilities and impressive overall performance incredibly useful.We know from user feedback that some applications need lower latency and a lower cost to serve. This inspired us to keep innovating, so today, we’re introducing Gemini 1.5 Flash: a model that’s lighter-weight than 1.5 Pro, and designed to be fast and efficient to serve at scale.Both 1.5 Pro and 1.5 Flash are available in public preview with a 1 million token context window in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. And now, 1.5 Pro is also available with a 2 million token context window via waitlist to developers using the API and to Google Cloud customers.We’re also introducing updates across the Gemini family of models, announcing our next generation of open models, Gemma 2, and sharing progress on the future of AI assistants, with Project Astra.Context lengths of leading foundation models compared with Gemini 1.5’s 2 million token capability1.5 Flash is the newest addition to the Gemini model family and the fastest Gemini model served in the API. It’s optimized for high-volume, high-frequency tasks at scale, is more cost-efficient to serve and features our breakthrough long context window.While it’s a lighter weight model than 1.5 Pro, it’s highly capable of multimodal reasoning across vast amounts of information and delivers impressive quality for its size.The new Gemini 1.5 Flash model is optimized for speed and efficiency, is highly capable of multimodal reasoning and features our breakthrough long context window.1.5 Flash excels at summarization, chat applications, image and video captioning, data extraction from long documents and tables, and more. This is because it’s been trained by 1.5 Pro through a process called “distillation,” where the most essential knowledge and skills from a larger model are transferred to a smaller, more efficient model.Read more about 1.5 Flash in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report, on the Gemini technology page, and learn about 1.5 Flash’s availability and pricing.Over the last few months, we’ve significantly improved 1.5 Pro, our best model for general performance across a wide range of tasks.Beyond extending its context window to 2 million tokens, we’ve enhanced its code generation, logical reasoning and planning, multi-turn conversation, and audio and image understanding through data and algorithmic advances. We see strong improvements on public and internal benchmarks for each of these tasks.1.5 Pro can now follow increasingly complex and nuanced instructions, including ones that specify product-level behavior involving role, format and style. We’ve improved control over the model’s responses for specific use cases, like crafting the persona and response style of a chat agent or automating workflows through multiple function calls. And we’ve enabled users to steer model behavior by setting system instructions.We added audio understanding in the Gemini API and Google AI Studio, so 1.5 Pro can now reason across image and audio for videos uploaded in Google AI Studio. And we’re now integrating 1.5 Pro into Google products, including Gemini Advanced and in Workspace apps.Read more about 1.5 Pro in our updated Gemini 1.5 technical report and on the Gemini technology page.Gemini Nano is expanding beyond text-only inputs to include images as well. Starting with Pixel, applications using Gemini Nano with Multimodality will be able to understand the world the way people do — not just through text, but also through sight, sound and spoken language.Read more about Gemini 1.0 Nano on Android.Today, we’re also sharing a series of updates to Gemma, our family of open models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.We’re announcing Gemma 2, our next generation of open models for responsible AI innovation. Gemma 2 has a new architecture designed for breakthrough performance and efficiency, and will be available in new sizes.The Gemma family is also expanding with PaliGemma, our first vision-language model inspired by PaLI-3. And we’ve upgraded our Responsible Generative AI Toolkit with LLM Comparator for evaluating the quality of model responses.Read more on the Developer blog.As part of Google DeepMind’s mission to build AI responsibly to benefit humanity, we’ve always wanted to develop universal AI agents that can be helpful in everyday life. That’s why today, we’re sharing our progress in building the future of AI assistants with Project Astra (advanced seeing and talking responsive agent).To be truly useful, an agent needs to understand and respond to the complex and dynamic world just like people do — and take in and remember what it sees and hears to understand context and take action. It also needs to be proactive, teachable and personal, so users can talk to it naturally and without lag or delay.While we’ve made incredible progress developing AI systems that can understand multimodal information, getting response time down to something conversational is a difficult engineering challenge. Over the past few years, we’ve been working to improve how our models perceive, reason and converse to make the pace and quality of interaction feel more natural.Building on Gemini, we’ve developed prototype agents that can process information faster by continuously encoding video frames, combining the video and speech input into a timeline of events, and caching this information for efficient recall.By leveraging our leading speech models, we also enhanced how they sound, giving the agents a wider range of intonations. These agents can better understand the context they’re being used in, and respond quickly, in conversation.With technology like this, it’s easy to envision a future where people could have an expert AI assistant by their side, through a phone or glasses. And some of these capabilities are coming to Google products, like the Gemini app and web experience, later this year.We’ve made incredible progress so far with our family of Gemini models, and we’re always striving to advance the state-of-the-art even further. By investing in a relentless production line of innovation, we’re able to explore new ideas at the frontier, while also unlocking the possibility of new and exciting Gemini use cases.Learn more about Gemini and its capabilities.
